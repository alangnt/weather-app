# 🌍 Global Weather App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Introduction

Despite numerous weather apps available in the market, many users still struggle with:
- ❌ Lack of real-time updates
- 🌍 Limited global coverage
- 😞 Poor user experience and interface design

Our Global Weather App addresses these issues by providing:

- ⏱️ **Real-Time Updates**: Continuous updates to provide the latest weather information.
- 🌐 **Worldwide Coverage**: Access weather data for any city around the globe.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and attractive design for a better user experience.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
